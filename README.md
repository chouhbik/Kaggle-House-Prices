## Start here if...
You have some experience with R or Python and machine learning basics. This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand their skill set before trying a featured competition. 

## Competition Description


Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
